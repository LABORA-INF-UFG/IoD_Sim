# IoD_Sim

[IoD_Sim](https://telematics.poliba.it/iod-sim) is an open source and
system-level simulator for the IoD ([Internet of
Drones](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7423671)).

Developed on top of the well-known [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) (Network
Simulator 3), it implements a flexible simulation platform constisting on key
networking elements, i.e., drones, network access points, and
Zone Service Providers, peripherals, buildings, and an extensive configuration
interface for high-level and low-code scenario design.

The IoD_Sim repository is where this
software is developed and there are many ways in which you can participate in
the project, for example:
* [Submit bugs and feature requests](issues) and help us verify as they are
  checked in.
* Review [source code changes](pulls).
* Review the [documentation](doc) and make pull requests for anything, from
  typos to new content.

IoD_Sim is primarily compatible with **Linux**-based operating systems. You can
test it on macOS, altough we are not focused on providing first-class support
for it. For macOS, Windows, or any other operating system, you are encouraged
to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
[WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) or any other
(pseudo)virtualization platform that can provide you a stable Linux-based work
environment. You are welcome to provide new compatibility solutions any time.

For more details, a dedicated publication that describes the entire simulation
platform is available on [IEEE Internet of Things Journal](https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2022.3207324), with its preprint freely downloadable from [arXiv](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.13710).

Want to build scenarios through a GUI? [Airflow](https://github.com/GiovanniGrieco/IoD_Sim-airflow) is a Visual Programming Editor ad-hoc for IoD_Sim! It relies on [splash](https://github.com/GiovanniGrieco/IoD_Sim-splash) to transpile C++ models in Python visual blocks.

## Getting Started

This project can be quick started if opened as folder on Visual Studio Code.
Tasks are already provided in sequence to:
* Install dependencies
* Download and integrate IoD Sim with third-party dependencies
* Build IoD Sim
* Execute IoD Sim scenarios

> Please note that the instructions provided hereby use the following notation. If a command line
> starts with a $, that means that it should be executed as a normal user.
> Otherwise, if a command is preceded by a #, that means that you should run
> the command under elevated privileges, e.g. root and/or sudo.

Given a Linux-based shell, ensure you have installed `git`. Then clone this
repository through the following command:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/telematics-lab/IoD_Sim.git
$ cd IoD_Sim/
```
If you have Visual Studio Code installed, just execute `code .` and follow the
aforementioned tasks. Otherwise, execute the following sequence of commands to
configure and build the project:
```
$ ./tools/install-dependencies.sh
$ ./tools/prepare-ns3.sh
$ cd ns3/
$ ./ns3 configure --enable-examples \
                  --disable-mpi     \
                  --disable-python  \
                  --enable-modules=drone
$ ./ns3 build
```
